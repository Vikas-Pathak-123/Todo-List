# React Todo App.

A complete todo application with all features.

**live demo: [https://wc-react-todo-app.netlify.app/](https://wc-react-todo-app.netlify.app/)**
## Project Description

I built a full-featured to-do application for the project. I completed all CRUD tasks. I utilise Redux and React.js to manage our states. Additionally, I've learnt how to use 'Framer Motion' to create basic animations. This app is completely "beginner" friendly. I hope you find it enjoyable.

## What I have learned with this App?
